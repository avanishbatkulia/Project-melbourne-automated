# Project-mebourne-automated
🗺️ Daily Melbourne Incident Processing
This project automatically extracts, processes, and maps daily incidents (such as accidents, crimes, etc.) from Melbourne news articles.
It uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and OpenAI's GPT models to refine location information and plot it for insights.

🔥 Features
Automatically runs daily via a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow.

Extracts locations from news article texts using spaCy NER.

Refines and filters locations to only Australia-based incidents using OpenAI.

Pushes updated processed files back to the GitHub repository.

Supports easy integration with mapping tools for visualization.

⚙️ How It Works
GitHub Action or Google Colab is triggered daily.

Clone the repository into Colab or runner.

Extract locations from news articles.

Use OpenAI to validate and refine the location data.

Push the updated results (like final_location_dataset.csv) back to the GitHub repository.

🚀 Tech Stack
Python 3.10

spaCy

OpenAI GPT-3.5

pandas

GitHub Actions

Google Colab (Optional for heavy processing)

🛠️ Setup
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set your OpenAI API key securely as an environment variable:

bash
Copy
Edit
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
Run the main script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python project_Melbourne(31_01).py
🧠 Notes
Do not hardcode your OpenAI API key into the script for security.

You can connect your GitHub to Google Colab for running heavier pipelines if needed.

Always validate results, especially if using AI models for critical decision-making.

📅 Automation
This project uses GitHub Actions to:

Run the pipeline every day at a scheduled time.

Optionally trigger the script manually if needed.

Update the output files automatically without any manual work.
